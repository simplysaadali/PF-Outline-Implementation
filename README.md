# Programming Fundamentals – C++ (Core Concepts)

## Overview

This repository contains **core programming fundamentals implemented entirely in C++**.
All examples, logic, and implementations use **C++ only**, focusing on building strong foundational concepts required for advanced programming, data structures, and software development.

---

## Objectives

* Build strong fundamentals using **C++**
* Understand program logic, flow, and memory basics
* Prepare for advanced topics like **OOP, DSA, and system-level programming**
